## ‚ùì Can I get banned?

Nope impossible because it doesn't interact with the game memory at all , that's what makes it better than any other instalock page out here 

## FAQ
- Why is my antivirus blocking Agent Picker?
> the executable(.exe) version was compiled in a way that your antivirus doesn't like(?), but yes it is safe, you can review the source code and compile it yourself, you will get the same result.

- How it works ?
> your screen is a 2D screen so everytime you move your cursor it has a specific X and Y coordinates, all i did is taking every agent cooridnates and and the LOCK BUTTON cooridnates , then i automated the process so your cursor teleport in the smallest period of time.

## ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Support / Feedback:

You can also make an issue on this repository and I'll check it out. Or you can hit me up on Discord `kowdonowdooo` <br>
This tool only works if you play on NATIVE RESOLUTION ( 1920 x 1080 ) if you play on streched rez or any resolution beside the native one it won't work , i will add further resolution if this shit get somehow viral 
<br>
Note that I do not plan on developing this further, but I will maintain the code and update agents as time passes.
