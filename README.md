Nope impossible because it doensn't interact with the game memory at all , that what makes it better than any other instalock page out here 

## FAQ
- Why is my antivirus blocking Agent Picker?
> the executable(.exe) version was compiled in a way that your antivirus doesn't like(?), but yes it is safe, you can review the source code and compile it yourself, you will get the same result.

- How it works ?
> your screen is a 2D screen so everytime you move your cursor it has a specific X and Y coordinates, all i did is taking every agent cooridnatesand and the LOCK BUTTON cooridnates , then i automated the process so your cursor teleport in the smallest period of time possible ,
